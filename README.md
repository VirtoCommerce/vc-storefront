Official online shopping website based on [Virto Commerce Platform written on ASP.NET Core](https://virtocommerce.com/microsoft-ecommerce-platform). The website is a client application for VC Platform and uses only public APIs while communicating.

It is possible to run multiple different stores (web sites) on top of Virto Commerce. Each store (website) might have its own theme with a specific layout still being based on the same catalog and customer data.

It is possible, for example, to create sites with a different design for different product categories still having all products in the same backend.

Another option is to create different sites for different regions so that a specific product set will be available to a specific region, is still based on one product data.

It is also possible to connect Virto Commerce to multiple touchpoints so that customers will get a real omnichannel experience.

## Deploy Storefront

> If Platform and Storefront are deployed in the same on-premises environment, Storefront should be deployed on different port then Platform. You can do it by `dotnet run CLI`

### Install the `vc-storefront`
- Download [latest release](https://github.com/VirtoCommerce/vc-storefront/releases/latest) and unpack in to a local folder
- Or Clone [https://github.com/VirtoCommerce/vc-storefront](https://github.com/VirtoCommerce/vc-storefront) in to a local folder

- Open the **appsettings.json** file in a text editor.
- In the **Endpoint** section change **Url**, **UserName**, **Password** with correct path and credentials for Virto Commerce Platform:

```json
...
 "Endpoint": {
     "Url": "https://localhost:5001",
     "UserName": "admin",
     "Password": "store",
```

### Setup `B2B Mercury theme`

```bash
# Clone repo into the folder where storefront is installed
git clone https://github.com/VirtoCommerce/vue-starter-theme.git "C:\vc-storefront\wwwroot\cms-content\themes\{store-name}\default"
# Change the current directory
cd C:\vc-storefront\wwwroot\cms-content\themes\{store-name}\default
# install dependencies
yarn
# Start theme in development mode with HMR support
yarn dev
# or build theme to get installable artifact
yarn compress
```

### Run `vc-storefront` application

```bash
# change the current directory
cd C:\vc-storefront
# build and run storefront application
dotnet run
```

### FAQ

#### Running the Storefront only on HTTP schema

* In order to run the platform only at HTTP schema in production mode, it's enough to pass only HTTP URLs in `--urls` argument of the `dotnet` command.

```console
  dotnet VirtoCommerce.Storefront.dll --urls=http://localhost:5002
```

#### Running the Platform on HTTPS schema

* Install and trust HTTPS certificate

Run to trust the .NET Core SDK HTTPS development certificate:

```console
    dotnet dev-certs https --trust
```

Read more about [enforcing HTTPS in ASP.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/enforcing-ssl?view=aspnetcore-3.0&tabs=visual-studio#trust)


```console
    dotnet VirtoCommerce.Storefront.dll --urls=https://localhost:4302/
```

* Trust the .Net Core Development Self-Signed Certificate. More details on trusting the self-signed certificate can be found [here](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/robert_mcmurray/2013/11/15/how-to-trust-the-iis-express-self-signed-certificate/)

#### Forward the scheme for Linux and non-IIS reverse proxies

Apps that call UseHttpsRedirection and UseHsts put a site into an infinite loop if deployed to an Azure Linux App Service, Azure Linux virtual machine (VM), Linux container or behind any other reverse proxy besides IIS. TLS is terminated by the reverse proxy, and Kestrel isn't made aware of the correct request scheme. OAuth and OIDC also fail in this configuration because they generate incorrect redirects. UseIISIntegration adds and configures Forwarded Headers Middleware when running behind IIS, but there's no matching automatic configuration for Linux (Apache or Nginx integration).

To forward the scheme from the proxy in non-IIS scenarios, set `ASPNETCORE_FORWARDEDHEADERS_ENABLED` environment variable to `true`.

For more details on how it works, see the Microsoft [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/proxy-load-balancer?view=aspnetcore-5.0#forward-the-scheme-for-linux-and-non-iis-reverse-proxies).
